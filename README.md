This is the Capstone project for my Bioinformatics major at BYU, The project was maintenace, updating, and cleaning of a Pipeline created by Dr. Jesse Brienholt. The pipelines purpose is to read in genetic code of diffrent beetles and make comparisons between the two. (Ideally to make connections between the genetic history/similiarity between the two beetles givem. Our goals were also to expand the pipeline to be able to find comparions between beetles and dragonflies/mayflies.
